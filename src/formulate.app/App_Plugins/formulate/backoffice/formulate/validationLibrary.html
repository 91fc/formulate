    <h2>Validation Library</h2>
    <p>
        The validation library is where you can configure your validations for use on fields. Here are some examples:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            A regular expression to validate the format of email addresses.
        </li>
        <li>
            A validation that ensures the phone number entered by a user is not a known invalid phone number (e.g., one with a 555 area code).
        </li>
    </ul>
