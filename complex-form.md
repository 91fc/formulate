# Creating a Complex Form
To create a complex form, follow these steps:

* Create a simple form by following [these instructions](/simple-form).
* Add some validations (by default, Formulate supports mandatory and regular expression validations).
* Select those validations on some of your fields.
* Create a list of data under the data values tree.
* Create a drop down field and select that list of data to populate the drop down.
* Add a few more fields.
* Add as many buttons fields as you like.
* Edit your layout to add multiple columns and rows.
