# Formulate
Formulate is (or, more accurately, will be) a form builder for Umbraco.

Check back in early 2016 for more information.

Until then, read this to get an idea of what Formulate will look like: [Replacing Contour with Something Better](https://our.umbraco.org/forum/umbraco-7/developing-umbraco-7-packages/69933-replacing-contour-umbraco-forms-with-something-better)
