# Roadmap
These are some things that are on the horizon for Formulate:

* **Meta Information.** The idea is that you can attach information to anything (e.g., a form or a field). One use case would be to mark certain fields as belonging to particular groups (e.g., to style fields differently).
* **jQuery Template.** In addition to the AngularJS template, there will eventually also be a jQuery template. Though, as the [FAQ](/faq) indicates, you can already use the AngularJS template with jQuery websites.
* **SQL Persistence.** In addition to the current JSON file system persistence, there will eventually be persistence to SQL Server.
* **Store Submission Handler.** There is currently only a handler that sends an email on form submission. There will eventually be a handler that stores the values in a form submission and a dashboard to display those stored values.
* **Field Comparison Validation.** Once implemented, this can be used to ensure that two fields match (e.g., for a password confirmation field).
* **More Field Types.** Only a few field types are currently supported. As time goes on, more and more will be supported.
* **Export / Import.** While it is possible to copy forms from the file system already, the ability to do so from the UI will eventually be added.
* **Translate Back Office.** The back office will be modified so that it supports the typical way of translating items in the back office (i.e., so people who understand languages other than English can use Formulate).
* **Various Enhancements.** You can see a few more planned enhancements here: [Formulate Enhancements](https://github.com/rhythmagency/formulate/labels/enhancement).
