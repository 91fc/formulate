# Roadmap
These are some things that are on the horizon for Formulate:

* **Meta Information.** The idea is that you can attach information to anything (e.g., a form or a field). One use case would be to mark certain fields as belonging to particular groups (e.g., to style fields differently).
* **SQL Persistence.** In addition to the current JSON file system persistence, there will eventually be persistence to SQL Server.
* **Field Comparison Validation.** Once implemented, this can be used to ensure that two fields match (e.g., for a password confirmation field).
* **Export / Import.** While it is possible to copy forms from the file system already, the ability to do so from the UI will eventually be added.
* **Various Enhancements.** You can see a few more planned enhancements here: [Formulate Enhancements](https://github.com/rhythmagency/formulate/labels/enhancement).
