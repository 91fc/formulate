# Roadmap
These are some things that are on the horizon for Formulate:

* **Meta Information.** The idea is that you can attach information to anything (e.g., a form or a field). One use case would be to mark certain fields as belonging to particular groups (e.g., to style fields differently).
* **jQuery Template.** In addition to the AngularJS template, there will eventually also be a jQuery template.
* **SQL Persistence.** In addition to the current JSON file system persistence, there will eventually be persistence to SQL Server.
* **Store Submission Handler.** There is currently only a handler that sends an email on form submission. There will eventually be a handler that stores the values in a form submission and a dashboard to display those stored values.
* **Field Comparison Validation.** Once implemented, this can be used to ensure that two fields match (e.g., for a password confirmation field).
* **More Field Types.** Only a few field types are currently supported. As time goes on, more and more will be supported.
* **Various Enhancements.** You can see a few more planned enhancements here: https://github.com/rhythmagency/formulate/labels/enhancement
